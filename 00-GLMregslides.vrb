\frametitle{Negative Binomial Regression with \texttt{R} }
\Large
The outcome variable in a negative binomial regression cannot have negative numbers.
You will need to use the \texttt{m1\$resid} command to obtain the residuals from our model to check other assumptions of the negative binomial model (see Cameron and Trivedi (1998) and Dupont (2002) for more information).
