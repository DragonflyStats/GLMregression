\textbf{Things to consider}
\begin{itemize}
\item Empty cells or small cells: You should check for empty or small cells by doing a cross-tabulation between categorical predictors and the outcome variable. If a cell has very few cases (a small cell), the model may become unstable or it might not even run at all.
\end{itemize}
