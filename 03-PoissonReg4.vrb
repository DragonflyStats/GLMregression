\begin{itemize}

\item Many different measures of pseudo-R-squared exist. They all attempt to provide information similar to that provided by R-squared in OLS regression, even though none of them can be interpreted exactly as R-squared in OLS regression is interpreted.

%For a discussion of various pseudo-R-squares, see Long and Freese (2006) or our FAQ page What are pseudo R-squareds?.
\item Poisson regression is estimated via maximum likelihood estimation. It usually requires a large sample size.
