\begin{itemize}
\item Collapsing number of categories to two and then doing a logistic regression: This approach suffers from loss of information and changes the original research questions to very different ones.
\item Ordinal logistic regression: If the outcome variable is truly ordered and if it also satisfies the assumption of proportional odds, then switching to ordinal logistic regression will make the model more parsimonious.
\item Alternative-specific multinomial probit regression, which allows different error structures therefore allows to relax the IIA assumption. This requires that the data structure be choice-specific.
\item Nested logit model, another way to relax the IIA assumption, also requires the data structure be choice-specific.
\end{itemize}
